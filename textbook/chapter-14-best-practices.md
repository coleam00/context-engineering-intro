## 🚀 Advanced Optimization Techniques

### **Context Density Optimization**

#### **The Information Value Matrix**

Not all context is equally valuable. Optimize by focusing on high-impact information:

```markdown
## Information Value Assessment:

High Value, High Frequency (Optimize First):
- Core patterns used in 80% of features
- Common error patterns and their solutions
- Primary technology stack conventions
- Standard testing and validation approaches

High Value, Low Frequency (Document Well):
- Complex integration patterns
- Security-critical implementations
- Performance optimization techniques
- Debugging and troubleshooting guides

Low Value, High Frequency (Simplify):
- Redundant or overlapping examples
- Obvious or trivial patterns
- Information available in official docs
- Historical context no longer relevant

Low Value, Low Frequency (Remove):
- Outdated patterns and technologies
- One-off implementations
- Experimental code that didn't work
- Context for deprecated features
```

#### **Context Layering Strategy**

Structure context in layers for optimal AI consumption:

```markdown
## Three-Layer Context Architecture:

### Layer 1: Essential Context (Always Loaded)
- Core patterns and conventions
- Primary technology stack
- Critical gotchas and constraints
- Basic quality standards

### Layer 2: Feature Context (Loaded Per Domain)
- Domain-specific patterns
- Feature-type examples
- Integration requirements
- Specialized validation rules

### Layer 3: Advanced Context (Loaded When Needed)
- Complex edge cases
- Performance optimization
- Security considerations
- Advanced integration patterns
```

### **Pattern Abstraction and Reuse**

#### **Meta-Pattern Development**

Extract patterns from patterns for higher-level reuse:

```python
# examples/meta_patterns/service_pattern.py
"""
Meta-pattern for service layer implementation.
This template can be adapted for any domain service.
"""

from typing import TypeVar, Generic, Optional, List
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

T = TypeVar('T')  # Entity type
ID = TypeVar('ID')  # ID type
CreateSchema = TypeVar('CreateSchema')  # Creation schema
UpdateSchema = TypeVar('UpdateSchema')  # Update schema

class BaseService(Generic[T, ID, CreateSchema, UpdateSchema], ABC):
    """
    Base service pattern that all domain services should follow.
    
    This meta-pattern ensures consistency across all service implementations:
    - Dependency injection for repositories
    - Transaction management
    - Input validation
    - Error handling patterns
    - Logging and monitoring
    """
    
    def __init__(self, repository: 'BaseRepository[T, ID]', validator: 'BaseValidator'):
        self.repository = repository
        self.validator = validator
    
    async def create(self, data: CreateSchema) -> T:
        """Standard creation pattern with validation and transaction management."""
        # Pattern: Pre-validation
        await self.validator.validate_create(data)
        
        # Pattern: Transaction management
        async with self.repository.transaction():
            entity = await self.repository.create(data)
            await self._post_create_actions(entity)
            return entity
    
    async def get_by_id(self, id: ID) -> Optional[T]:
        """Standard retrieval pattern with error handling."""
        entity = await self.repository.get_by_id(id)
        if entity:
            await self._post_retrieve_actions(entity)
        return entity
    
    async def update(self, id: ID, data: UpdateSchema) -> T:
        """Standard update pattern with validation and conflict detection."""
        # Pattern: Existence check
        entity = await self.repository.get_by_id(id)
        if not entity:
            raise NotFoundError(f"Entity with id {id} not found")
        
        # Pattern: Update validation
        await self.validator.validate_update(entity, data)
        
        # Pattern: Optimistic concurrency control
        async with self.repository.transaction():
            updated_entity = await self.repository.update(entity, data)
            await self._post_update_actions(updated_entity)
            return updated_entity
    
    # Template methods for subclass customization
    async def _post_create_actions(self, entity: T) -> None:
        """Override for post-creation logic (e.g., sending notifications)."""
        pass
    
    async def _post_retrieve_actions(self, entity: T) -> None:
        """Override for post-retrieval logic (e.g., access logging)."""
        pass
    
    async def _post_update_actions(self, entity: T) -> None:
        """Override for post-update logic (e.g., cache invalidation)."""
        pass

# Concrete implementation example:
class UserService(BaseService[User, int, UserCreate, UserUpdate]):
    """User service following the standard service pattern."""
    
    async def _post_create_actions(self, user: User) -> None:
        """Send welcome email after user creation."""
        await self.email_service.send_welcome_email(user)
    
    async def _post_update_actions(self, user: User) -> None:
        """Invalidate user cache after update."""
        await self.cache_service.invalidate_user_cache(user.id)
```

#### **Context Templates for Rapid Deployment**

Create templates for common Context Engineering scenarios:

```markdown
# templates/api_feature_template.md

## FEATURE TEMPLATE: REST API Endpoint

### Standard API Feature Structure:
```
API Feature: [Feature Name]
├── Models (Pydantic schemas for request/response)
├── Repository (Database access layer)
├── Service (Business logic layer)
├── Routes (FastAPI endpoint definitions)
├── Tests (Unit, integration, and API tests)
└── Documentation (OpenAPI spec updates)
```

### Required Context References:
- examples/api/[similar_endpoint].py - Route definition patterns
- examples/services/[domain]_service.py - Business logic patterns
- examples/models/[domain]_models.py - Data model patterns
- examples/tests/test_[domain]_api.py - Testing patterns

### Standard Validation Commands:
```bash
# Style and type checking
ruff check . && mypy .

# Unit tests with coverage
pytest tests/unit/test_[feature].py --cov

# Integration tests
pytest tests/integration/test_[feature]_api.py

# API documentation validation
python scripts/validate_openapi_spec.py
```

### Common Gotchas for API Features:
- Ensure proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 422, 500)
- Add rate limiting for all endpoints
- Include request/response validation with Pydantic
- Follow existing authentication/authorization patterns
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Update OpenAPI documentation
```

├── Security and compliance requirements
├── Testing and quality standards
└── Documentation standards

Team Level  
├── Domain-specific patterns (frontend, backend, data)
├── Team preferences and conventions
├── Integration patterns for team's services
└── Team-specific quality gates

Project Level
├── Project-specific business rules
├── Feature-specific patterns
├── Project constraints and gotchas
└── Custom validation requirements
```

#### **Context Synchronization**

```markdown

```

## 🔧 Performance Optimization

### **Context Processing Efficiency**

#### **Context Compression Techniques**

```markdown
## Efficient Context Patterns:

### Reference-Heavy Context:
Instead of duplicating information, use references:

❌ Inefficient:
```markdown
## EXAMPLES:
Copy the entire auth_routes.py file here...
Copy the entire user_service.py file here...
```

✅ Efficient:
```markdown
## EXAMPLES:
- auth/routes.py:45-67 - JWT token creation pattern
- services/user_service.py:create_user() - Service layer pattern with validation
- tests/test_auth.py:test_login_success() - Authentication testing pattern
```

### Context Hierarchies:
Layer context from general to specific:

```markdown
## Context Layer 1: Foundation
[Core patterns that apply to all features]

## Context Layer 2: Domain-Specific  
[Patterns specific to this type of feature]

## Context Layer 3: Implementation Details
[Specific implementation guidance for this exact feature]
```
```

#### **Context Caching Strategies**

```markdown
## Caching for Large Teams:

### Pre-computed Context Bundles:
```bash
# Generate context bundles for common scenarios
./scripts/generate_context_bundle.py --type=api_endpoint
./scripts/generate_context_bundle.py --type=data_processing
./scripts/generate_context_bundle.py --type=frontend_component
```

### Dynamic Context Assembly:
```python
# Context assembly system
class ContextAssembler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
    
    def get_context_for_feature(self, feature_type: str, domain: str) -> str:
        """Dynamically assemble context based on feature requirements."""
        cache_key = f"{feature_type}:{domain}"
        
        if cache_key in self.cache:
            return self.cache[cache_key]
        
        context = self._build_context(feature_type, domain)
        self.cache[cache_key] = context
        return context
    
    def _build_context(self, feature_type: str, domain: str) -> str:
        """Build context from components."""
        components = [
            self._get_base_context(),
            self._get_feature_context(feature_type),
            self._get_domain_context(domain),
            self._get_integration_context(feature_type, domain)
        ]
        return "\n\n".join(filter(None, components))
```
```
