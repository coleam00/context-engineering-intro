## üéØ Quick Command Reference

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/generate-prp` | Creates comprehensive PRPs | After writing INITIAL.md |
| `/execute-prp` | Implements features from PRPs | After generating/reviewing PRP |
| `/generate-pydantic-ai-prp` | AI agent-specific PRP generation | For Pydantic AI projects |
| `/execute-pydantic-ai-prp` | AI agent implementation | For Pydantic AI PRPs |

## üìù Core Commands

### **`/generate-prp` Command**

#### **Purpose**
Generates comprehensive Product Requirements Prompts (PRPs) from INITIAL.md files.

#### **Syntax**
```bash
/generate-prp <path-to-initial-file>

# Examples:
/generate-prp INITIAL.md
/generate-prp features/user-auth.md
/generate-prp requirements/api-redesign.md
```

#### **What It Does**
1. **Reads feature requirements** from the specified INITIAL.md file
2. **Researches codebase** for similar patterns and implementations
3. **Gathers external documentation** from links provided
4. **Creates comprehensive PRP** with implementation blueprint
5. **Saves PRP** to `PRPs/[feature-name].md`

#### **Expected Input Format**
```markdown
## FEATURE:
[Detailed feature description]

## EXAMPLES:
- path/to/example.py - Description of relevant pattern
- path/to/another_example.py - Another relevant pattern

## DOCUMENTATION:
- Library docs: https://example.com/docs
- API reference: https://api.example.com/docs

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
- Important constraint 1
- Gotcha to avoid
- Performance requirement
```

#### **Command Implementation**
```markdown
# From .claude/commands/generate-prp.md

## Research Process
1. **Codebase Analysis**
   - Search for similar features/patterns in the codebase
   - Identify files to reference in PRP
   - Note existing conventions to follow

2. **External Research**
   - Library documentation (include specific URLs)
   - Implementation examples
   - Best practices and common pitfalls

## PRP Generation
- Use PRPs/templates/prp_base.md as template
- Include all necessary context for one-pass implementation
- Add executable validation commands
- Score confidence level (1-10) for implementation success
```

#### **Troubleshooting**
```markdown
**Issue**: Generic PRP generated
**Solution**: Add more specific examples and constraints to INITIAL.md

**Issue**: Missing technology-specific guidance
**Solution**: Ensure CLAUDE.md has clear technology stack preferences

**Issue**: Validation commands don't work
**Solution**: Update validation commands in PRP template for your project
```

### **`/execute-prp` Command**

#### **Purpose**
Systematically implements features based on comprehensive PRPs.

#### **Syntax**
```bash
/execute-prp <path-to-prp-file>

# Examples:
/execute-prp PRPs/user-authentication.md
/execute-prp PRPs/api-refactor.md
/execute-prp features/payment-integration.md
```

#### **What It Does**
1. **Loads PRP context** completely and validates understanding
2. **Creates implementation plan** using TodoWrite for task tracking
3. **Executes systematically** following PRP guidance step by step
4. **Validates progress** at each level (syntax, tests, integration)
5. **Ensures completion** by checking all success criteria

#### **Execution Process**
```markdown
## 5-Phase Execution:

Phase 1: Context Loading
- Read entire PRP document
- Understand business goals and technical requirements
- Review all referenced examples and documentation

Phase 2: Planning (ULTRATHINK)
- Break down into manageable tasks
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Create detailed implementation strategy

Phase 3: Implementation
- Execute tasks systematically
- Follow established patterns from examples
- Maintain quality throughout process

Phase 4: Validation
- Run all quality gates from PRP
- Fix any issues discovered
- Ensure all tests pass

Phase 5: Completion
- Verify all success criteria met
- Document implementation decisions
- Extract reusable patterns for future use
```

#### **Command Implementation**
```markdown
# From .claude/commands/execute-prp.md

## Execution Process
1. **Load PRP** - Read and understand all context
2. **ULTRATHINK** - Create comprehensive plan
3. **Execute** - Implement following patterns
4. **Validate** - Run all quality gates
5. **Complete** - Ensure all requirements met

## Key Practices:
- Use TodoWrite tool for task tracking
- Reference PRP throughout implementation
- Run validation commands at each stage
- Document learnings and new patterns
```

#### **Troubleshooting**
```markdown
**Issue**: Implementation doesn't follow project patterns
**Solution**: Check that examples folder has representative patterns

**Issue**: Validation commands fail
**Solution**: Update validation commands for your specific tooling

**Issue**: Generated code is too complex/simple
**Solution**: Adjust PRP complexity and provide better examples
```
